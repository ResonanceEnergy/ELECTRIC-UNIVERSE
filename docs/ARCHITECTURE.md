# ARCHITECTURE — ELECTRIC UNIVERSE

## Purpose
Research platform exploring Electric Universe theory, plasma cosmology, and alternative physics frameworks.

## System Overview
```
[Research Sources] --> [Knowledge Graph] --> [Analysis]
[Content Engine]   --> [Publishing]      --> [Community]
```

## Components
- **Knowledge Graph**: Interconnected concepts, theories, evidence nodes
- **Research Sources**: Papers, videos, experiments ingestion
- **Content Engine**: Article/summary generation from research
- **Community**: Discussion, debate, contributor input

## Data Flow
Sources → Ingest → Graph → Analysis → Content → Publish

## Integration Points
- GEET-PLASMA-PROJECT (experimental validation)
- HUMAN-HEALTH (bio-electric connections)
- NCL doctrine storage

## Key Decisions
- Non-consensus science requires strong evidence tracking
- All claims linked to primary sources
